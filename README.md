We'll structure our code into five classes: ATM, User, Transaction, History, and Main.

User class will represent the user with their ID, PIN, and account details.
Transaction class will handle different types of transactions like withdraw, deposit, and transfer.
History class will keep track of transaction history.
ATM class will provide the main functionality of the ATM system.
Main class will contain the main method to start the application.


This is a basic implementation of an ATM system in Java. You can further extend and customize it according to your requirements, 
such as adding more validation checks, improving transaction handling, or enhancing the user interface.
